============

**pyemcee** is a Python implementation of the *affine-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler*, based on `sl_emcee <https://github.com/mcfit/sl_emcee>`_ by `M. A. Nowak <http://space.mit.edu/home/mnowak/isis_vs_xspec/>`_, an S-Lang/`ISIS <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/isis/>`_ implementation of the MCMC Hammer proposed by `Goodman & Weare (2010) <http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/camcos.2010.5.65>`_, and also implemented in Python (`emcee <https://github.com/dfm/emcee>`_) by `Foreman-Mackey et al. (2013) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125..306F>`_.
